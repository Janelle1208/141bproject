The topic of this project is about the diagnosis of breast cancer. **The main problem we attempt
to solve is to build a high accuracy model to predict breast cancer, and compare types
of models used in literature from ScienceDirect.** The reason we want to solve this is because
breast cancer has become a major health issue in recent years. Especially for women, about 1 in 8 of
them will develop breast cancer over their lifetime in the United States. The main objective of this
project is to discover, compare, and identify an effective way to predict the incidence of breast cancer
based on de-identified clinical records. Beside, by comparing the frequency of types of models used,
we can have a better view of future research interests of classifiers in breast cancer prediction.
